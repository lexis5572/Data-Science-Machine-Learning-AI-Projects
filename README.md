Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! his repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and AI. 


# Audio Sound Recognitions 

The audio classification implementation leverages Google's YAMNet, a deep learning model pre-trained on the AudioSet dataset. This state-of-the-art neural network efficiently identifies and classifies audio events across a comprehensive range of sound categories defined in the AudioSet ontology, enabling robust acoustic event detection and classification.
